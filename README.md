## Logic simulation and ATPG using PODEM

This repository contains my graguate coursework project for ESE 549 VLSI System Testing.

Implementing an algorithm in C++ to generate correct output of a large digital circuit. The algorithm also makes use of PODEM for Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) to find test vectors which detects all single stuck at faults in the circuits.

Contents to be posted soon.
